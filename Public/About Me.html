<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am a dedicated and proactive professional with a strong curiosity for learning and a commitment to continuous <br>
  improvement in my work. My creative passion for all art forms enriches my corporate endeavors, allowing me to bring <br>
  fresh perspectives and innovative solutions.</p>

<p>With a background in UX design, I have collaborated with organizations of various sizes, from large enterprises to <br>
  small startups. I am now seeking new challenges that will enable me to leverage my UX expertise in the development field. <br>
  My skills include creating design systems and style guides, fostering collaborative teamwork, and applying agile methodologies <br>
  such as Scrum and Kanban. I excel in problem-solving, possess strong communication and presentation skills, and have a keen <br>
  attention to detail.</p>

<p>I am proficient in various prototyping and design collaboration tools, including InVision, Azure, Miro, and Zeplin, <br>
  as well as project management tools like Trello and JIRA.</p> 

<p>On a personal note, I am an easy-going individual who enjoys reading, writing, watching TV shows and movies, attending concerts, <br>
  and playing Dungeons & Dragons with friends. Despite being naturally shy, I strive to overcome my barriers and include others in my <br>
  endeavors, fostering a collaborative environment.</p>
